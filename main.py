    Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Detection** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Detection** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    st.markdown("""
    The dataset used in this project is a curated and augmented version of the publicly available PlantVillage dataset from Kaggle. It has been enhanced through offline data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and color transformations. These augmentations help increase dataset diversity and improve the model‚Äôs ability to generalize.

    This version of the dataset contains approximately **87,000 RGB images** of healthy and diseased crop leaves, categorized into **38 distinct classes**. These classes cover a range of common plant diseases‚Äîbacterial, viral, and fungal‚Äîas well as healthy samples.

    To ensure effective training and validation:
    - **Training Set**: 70,295 images (80%)
    - **Validation Set**: 17,572 images (20%)
    - **Test Set**: 33 images (manually selected for final evaluation)

    The images are organized to preserve their respective class structure, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout the model's learning process.
